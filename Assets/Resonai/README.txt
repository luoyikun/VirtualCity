# Resonai Visual Search Plugin for Unity

Resonai Visual Search lets content creators (such as game developers) find the models that fit their scene in an intuitive and easy manner, by implementing shape based search.
Drag a model into Resonai Search window, and the Resonai search engine will find the models that are most similar to the one you have searched by. 
You can also search by text first, and continue to refine the results using visual search using one of the text-search results. 

## Getting Started

To open the Search Window you can either select:
Window > Resonai > Visual Search, or -
In the scene, right click on GameObjects with models, and “Resonai Search”.


### Prerequisites

You’ll need Mac or Windows PC with Unity 5.6.x and up.

### Installing
