# Release Note

### 3.8.0 (5 Sep, 2018)

* Post request on back button would work correctly.

### 3.7.1 (26 Jun, 2018)

::: danger
From Unity 2018, Gradle is used as the default build system, so we updated the integration method to make UniWebView works better in the new build system. If you are upgrading UniWebView from an earlier version, please refer to the [Adapting to AAR File](http://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/adapting-to-aar-file.html) documentation.

### 3.0.0 (27 Jun, 2017)

::: danger
3.0.0 is a major update of UniWebView. We rewote the whole software from scratch to bring your experience of using a web view in Unity to a next level. Be causion it is not compatible with UniWebView 2, there are quite a few breaking changes in this version. For migration from UniWebView 2 in detail, visit our [Migration Guide](http://docs.uniwebview.com/#/migration-guide) in documentation. To know the highlight of the version, check [this page](http://docs.uniwebview.com/#/version-highlight) for more.
:::

#### Add

* Better way to set frame of the web view. You can also use a reference `RectTransform` to set position and size.
* Use `WKWebView` instead of `UIWebView` on iOS.
* New pop-up style Unity Editor support on macOS. It is a fully functional tool for debugging purpose.
* A brandly new way to setup bridging between Unity and Cocoa native. Now there is no message sending delay.
* You can now set the position of toolbar to top or bottom on iOS.
* A leveled logger to log all UniWebView related information. See [UniWebViewLogger](http://docs.uniwebview.com/#/latest/api/uniwebviewlogger.html) documentation for more.
* Use a payload based callback API like transition and JavaScript related methods. It takes more data. See [UniWebViewNativeResultPayload](http://docs.uniwebview.com/#/latest/api/uniwebviewnativeresultpayload.html).
* SSL exception for white listed domain. It is useful for a untrusted certification but you still want to access.
* A method to get current web view HTML content as a string.

#### Fix

* UniWebView Android no longer requires to be the main activity.
* Uploading now could work properly on all supported devices.
* The url scheme based message now supports UTF-8 and url encoding directly.

* SetCookie and GetCookie methods to set and get a cookie for a specified URL and key.

#### Fix

::: danger
Notice: Unity dropped Windows Phone 8 support officially from 5.3. UniWebView will not continue development for Windows Phone as well from this version.
:::

Reason: The ammount of our Windows Phone users is very few compared to iOS and Android (it is less than 1% share according to report).
However, if we want to to support Windows Store App with Windows Phone 8.1 SDK or Windows 10 SDK, it would take even more time than either of other platforms.

Since the Windows Phone SDK itself is not backwards compatible, the transition from Windows 8 to 8.1 or 10 means we need to rewrite all code in the package.

We have only limited resource. To make sure we could build the asset in a better quality for most of our users, we decided to focus back to iOS and Android only from next version.

The current Windows Phone 8 support (UniWebViewWP.dll) will be kept in later versions of UniWebView for a while, but we are sorry that it doesn't seem to get updated anymore.

---

### 2.4.0 (4 Dec, 2015)

#### Add

* Built-in show/hide transition. You could now show or hide the webview with a transition effect. Currently we support fade in/out and transition from/to one of screen edges. Please take a look at reference of Show() and Hide() for more.
  Add: Recreate new demo scenes as a better tutorial. Now most of the useful features are contained in the demo scenes, with fully commented script to show how to use them.
* Now you can use "ESC" in OS X Editor to go back or close the web view.

#### Fix

* The color of iOS toolbar is now white. This fixed an issue that the clear background tool bar will become black if no web page is underneath.
* Fix an issue which cause show tool bar property not working in some situation.
* Adjust the behavior of insets, it is a preparation for later feature like insets translating. The API of insets remains the same now.

#### Remove

::: danger
This version dropped support for Unity 4.1.4. Now UniWebView starts from 4.2.2. And 1.7.x will be the last versions support Unity version below 4.4 (because there is a compile error in iOS 8 SDK in the exported Xcode project, which is annoying and makes the development harder).
:::

#### Add

* UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth. You can retrive the screen size in "point" instead of "pixel" with these two new API. See the migrate guide below for more.
* "tel:" link support for Android. Now you can open the telephone UI by a link like "tel:12345678".
* An example in demo file, to show how to handle the auto-orientation, with keeping the layout unchanged in both portrait and landscope.
* iOS 8 and 5.5 inch iPhone 6 Plus support.

#### Fix

* The auto-orientation issue on iOS 8. Now it works for both iOS 8 SDK.
* Trim the url leading and trailing spaces, making the behaviors the same for iOS and Android.

#### Deprecate

* UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() is now deprecated due to 3x size of iPhone 6 Plus. Use UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth to decide the insets for retina display now. See the migrate guide below for more.

#### Remove

* Remove the long-ago deprecated Dismiss().
* Remove support for Unity 4.1.4.

> Migrate Guide - If you are using UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() to decide the insets of UniWebView, you may want to look at the Migrate Guide:

Due to introduction of iPhone 6 Plus and its new @3x scale, the old way would not work well. Now, all screen-size-based insets calculation for UniWebView should NOT use RunningOnRetinaIOS anymore. Instead you should use UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth and specify the point directly. For example, if you want to show a webview taking the upper half of screen, before version 1.7.0, it might be something like this:

    int uiFactor = UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() ? 2 : 1;
    int bottomInset = Screen.height / ( 2 * uiFactor );
    _webView.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

Right now, with the new API, you can just use this:

    int bottomInset = (int)(UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight * 0.5f);
    _webView.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

No more ui factor and device-specified calculation needed.

To make sure you can notice this change, the usage of RunningOnRetinaIOS() will cause an error now. You can just delete all usage of that, and change your insets code like the example above.

---

### 1.6.1 (2 Sep, 2014)

#### Add

* A precompiled package for Vuforia's QCARPlayerNativeActivity activity. You can find it under the /UniWebView/Source/ThirdPartyJar folder.
